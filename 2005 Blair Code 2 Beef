It was all for nothing, the spin doctoring, the tireless campaigning, the haggling through Parliament. All of it will be washed away under the Tory-blue wave that burned your eyes tonight. Your ideals of a stronger, safer nation, burnt to ashes under the boots’ heel of that goddamn war.<br><br>Following such an electoral slaughterhouse, your resignation as Party Leader is assured, and no politicking will change that. Gordon Brown, having had the privilege of quietly doing his work out of the spotlight, will most likely win any leadership election to succeed you.
