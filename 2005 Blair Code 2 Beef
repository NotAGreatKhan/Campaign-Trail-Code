Will you push, with effort, to shoot this amendment proposal down?",

He was an inspiration, a man of extraordinary faith, dignity and courage. Throughout a hard and often difficult life, he stood for social justice and on the side of the oppressed… He never wavered, never flinched in the struggle for what he thought was good and right.Yet whatever his own hardship and experience of what was wrong in human nature, he never lost faith in the human spirit and its ultimate capacity to do good. He will be remembered with profound respect and admiration.”"
