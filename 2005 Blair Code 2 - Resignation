And now, <i>now</i>, your position may have just reached its expiry date. A cold melancholy has settled in the apartment complexes of Downing Street. As you go around your fellow cabinet members, their responses to you are strange in their unison and foreboding: “Prime Minister, we would like to support you all the way, but I just don’t believe that is sustainable anymore. It’s time for new blood”. It can’t be. It – it cannot be. There’s got to be something you can do.",
