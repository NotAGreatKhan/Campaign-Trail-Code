The ever-optimistic shred of your mind clings to the desperate volition of at least a narrow victory being possible, but then the seats come in. Seat after seat. Colleague after colleague, falling to a new Tory government. Your ideals of a renewed, safer nation, burnt to ashes under the heels of that damn war.</p><p>What exactly went wrong? Was it Iraq? Was it those blasted attacks that Howard threw at you? Whatever it was, you have lost the election, that’s all that truly matters to your unyielding ambitious conscience. It really is over. Perhaps you were not “winning the argument that economic dynamism and social justice must go hand in hand” after all. You call Howard to congratulate him for his victory, and prepare to give your last speech outside that now-looming black door.</p><p>You will almost certainly resign as party leader following this defeat, your merit as an election-winning machine definitively exhausted after this. It is likely your loyal Chancellor Gordon Brown will succeed you for leadership, and provide a more measured (if stale) voice to the Opposition. It is unlikely that Labour will secure power again for a while, though you are aware it is premature to make hurried conclusions now.</p><p>After more than a childhood’s worth of Conservative rule, you did not even get to serve half of that time as Prime Minister. And now, those snivelling sky-blue Tories will scurry their way back into government.</p><p>You can almost feel John Smith’s sorrowful bitterness at you, as you stare into the void. Into the abyss.</p>",

Nobody really anticipated this outcome, save for the Liberal Democrat hopefuls wishing to finally break into government. Whilst this is certainly disappointing for national security reforms you were hoping to make, there is an avenue for continued governance with a coalition via the Liberal Democrats if you are able to form such a government. Regardless of the outcome, it is clear the LibDems are significant winners tonight, and will make governance a multi-faceted task to perform.</p><p>Your mind wonders the many possibilities that could’ve unfolded, anything, just anything, better than this folly of a deadlock. What really went wrong? Was it the Iraq War? Was it the blasted attacks hurled at you? Whatever it was, it is likely you will resign as party leader within the next 1 to 2 years at the maximum.</p><p>Just when you thought you were past the thick of it, another roadblock has been lobbed at you. Coalition negotiations are going to be tough, but depending on the seat shares, there could be a viable way out for you.
